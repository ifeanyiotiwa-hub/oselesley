### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Java/Kotlin Backend Engineer and I love solving problems with code.

I enjoy discussions revolving around how tech is solving both simple and complex problems and rapidly changing the world around us.

I am currently taking a deep dive into the micronaut framework and its tradeoffs with spring and spring cloud in a cloud native environment.

After a long day of code I like to unwind by watching anime and reading about the latest developments in tech.
